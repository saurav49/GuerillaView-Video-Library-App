The fight was over, but the one that began well before the first round of their long-anticipated faceoff was still on. With their leader slumped over in defeat, McGregor’s camp directed the sort of personal attacks and bigoted slurs that have colored the entirety of UFC 229, which then lived up to its “bad blood” billing within and especially beyond the Octagon. #UFC #khabib #fight #conor #UFCUltimateFightingChampionship this  suggested videos",
