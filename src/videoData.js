      "Khabib nurmagomedov VS conor Mcgregor free fight don't forget to share and subscribe my channel....UFC 229: Khabib vs. McGregor was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) that was held on October 6, 2018 at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada, part of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area.....Instead of reveling in victory and extending his reign as the lightweight titleholder and first Muslim champion in the UFC, Nurmagomedov taunted McGregor and then rushed to his opponent’s corner. The fight was over, but the one that began well before the first round of their long-anticipated faceoff was still on. With their leader slumped over in defeat, McGregor’s camp directed the sort of personal attacks and bigoted slurs that have colored the entirety of UFC 229, which then lived up to its “bad blood” billing within and especially beyond the Octagon. #UFC #khabib #fight #conor #UFCUltimateFightingChampionship this  suggested videos",
